<p class="lead">The ESIGN Act and UETA establish that electronic records and signatures carry the same weight and legal effect as traditional paper documents and handwritten signatures, as stated:</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p>a signature, contract, or other record relating to such 
        transaction may not be denied legal effect, validity, or 
        enforceability solely because it is in electronic form;</p>
